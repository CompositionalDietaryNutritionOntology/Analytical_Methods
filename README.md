## CONTROLLED VOCABULARIES TO DESCRIBE ANALYTICAL METHOD PIPELINES FOR CHEMICAL COMPONENTS IN FOOD AND NATURAL THERAPEUTIC MATERIALS ##

Graham J King & Liliana Andrés-Hernandéz, Southern Cross University, Australia, Aug 2022

No dedicated machine-readable standards adequately represent the discrete process steps involved in compositional analysis of complex plant-derived materials marketed for food, nutraceutical or therapeutic purposes. Comparison of output from different laboratories and literature meta-analysis is often confounded by the inability to assign variance to each step and thus carry out deep mining of analytical datasets.

Many published sources refer to proprietary AOAC  methods. In practice, analytical laboratories often combine and adapt methods depending on client requirements and the material presented for analysis. 

Adopting controlled vocabularies as formal systems of knowledge representation enables diverse data sources to be annotated and facilitating exchange and analysis. The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry coordinates community development of interoperable ontologies, where terms are defined with structured relationships relevant to specific domains. 

The Compositional Dietary Nutrition Ontology (CDNO)  includes a major structured class to represent concentration of chemicals associated with food and nutrition (included in FoodON ), extensible to nutraceuticals and therapeutic materials. However, it currently lacks a methods class.  Although the Chemical Methods Ontology (CHMO)  provides a subset of relevant vocabulary, it lacks an intuitive systematic structure that reflects processing pipelines.

PROPOSAL: Establish a generic, structured analytical methods ontology associated with CDNO and FoodOn to annotate processing pipelines used for chemical compositional analysis from complex plant and other substrates.
•	Define major classes corresponded to each step in the sampling to analysis processing pipeline.
•	Establish ongoing discussion in GitHub forum and associated information via www.cdno.org website.
•	Engage with relevant analytical labs, regulators, researchers and other stakeholders.
•	Survey existing compendia including AOAC and ?, pharmacopeia, literature monographs and regulatory databases to identify and classify analytical processing steps.
•	Where possible, re-use and extend existing occurrent process terms from ontologies such as CHMO, OBI etc.
•	Annotate representative datasets as demonstration use-cases.

Funding model:
Development of a dedicated and generic Methodology ontology/class associated with CDNO and FoodON,  to include sets of terms covering each of the process steps from sample to recorded value. We estimate in the first instance this would require ~24 months’ work at an inclusive cost of US$300,000.
•	A consortium approach of global sector leaders would: 
o	spread the cost (eg 6 x $50k)
o	increase the likelihood of widespread adoption

Potential partners:
Industry:		We are actively seeking interested partners
Regulatory: 	US Food & Drugs Administration, AOAC, INFOODS, EuroFIR, Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, Standards Australia.
R&D and NFP:	A wider range of stakeholders, including service providers and instrument manufacturers are likely to have interest in establishing global standards.
